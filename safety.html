  	<h2>Safety Tips</h2>
  <dl>

    <dt> What should I do if I see a moose? </dt>
    <dd> Do not approach! A moose will charge at you if it feels you are too close. If you see a mother moose with her calf, leave the area. A mother is
		very protective over her calf and will charge if she thinks you threaten her calf.</dd>

		<dt> How do I know if a moose is about to charge? </dt>
		<dd> A moose can show many different signs that it is getting ready to charge. The moose might urinate, lay its ears down, smack its lips, show the
			whites of their eyes or throw their head up. </dd>

		<dt> What should I do if a moose charges?</dt>
		<dd>RUN! Try to put things, like trees, in between you and the moose. Run far and fast, as soon as the moose thinks you are far enough away from it,
			it will stop. </dd>

		<dt> Where can I find more information on moose? </dt>
		<dd> <a href="https://www.outdoors.org/articles/amc-outdoors/responding-to-moose-encounters#:~:text=Do%20not%20stand%20your%20ground,it%20will%20leave%20you%20alone."> Here! </a></dd>

		<dt> Can I feed wild animals? </dt>
		<dd> Do not feed the wildlife! They are perfectly capable of finding their own food,
				we don't want them to rely on humans to feed them. This will cause them to fear humans less and approach them more often, which could be
			dangerous.  </dd>

		<dt> What should I do if I see a bear? </dt>
		<dd> Do not approach! If the bear has not seen you, walk away slowly while keeping your eye on the bear. </dd>

		<dt> What should I do if the bear sees me? </dt>
		<dd> If the bear is close and sees you, you need to help it realize that you are a human, not prey. Talk to it in a low and calm manner and slowly wave your arms.
		Do NOT scream or make any sudden movements.	If the bear stands on its hind legs and comes closer, it is most likely just curious. Stand your ground, do NOT run away. A bear WILL chase you
			if you start running. Try to make yourself look as large as possible. The bear will most likely leave when it realizes you are not a threat.
			Then you can slowly walk away, avoiding making any loud noises. </dd>

		<dt> Where can I read more about bears? </dt>
		<dd> <a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/bears/safety.htm#:~:text=If%20the%20bear%20is%20stationary,stop%20and%20hold%20your%20ground."> Here! </a> </dd>

		<dt> Are sea otters dangerous? </dt>
	 	<dd> As cute as sea otters are, they are still dangerous animals. Sea otters have a strong bite and retractable claws that could severely injure a human.
			It is best to remain at least 50 feet away from wild sea otters. </dd>

		<dt> Want to adopt a sea otter? </dt>
		<dd> You can help protect sea otters by adopting one <a href="https://gifts.defenders.org/sea-otter-adoption-kit"> here! </a> The money helps educate people and
			protect otters from oil spills. </dd>

		<dt> Are Steller sea lions dangerous? </dt>
		<dd>Steller sea lions are generally curious about humans and don't want to harm them. However, they are large animals with powerful jaws that could still
		severely injure a human. It is best not to approach them.</dd>

		<dt> Should I keep food inside my tent? </dt>
		<dd> No! If a bear or other animal smells food or trash inside your tent they may tear open your tent trying to get to it. </dd>

		<dt> Where should I put my trash? </dt>
		<dd> Do not leave your trash out. This will most likely bring an animal to your campsite and they may spread the trash everywhere. If you're staying in
			a campground they will most likely have a designated place for you to throw away your trash. </dd>
