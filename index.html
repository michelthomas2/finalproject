				<h3> Moose </h3>
				<p>Alces, or moose, can stand anywhere from 5 to 6.5 feet tall at their shoulders and weigh 1,800 pounds. Male moose have large antlers that can
				span up to 6 feet. Moose are herbivores and live about 15 to 20 years. They tend to feed in tall grasses because it is hard for them to lower their heads.
			They are usually found in Northern United States and throughout Canada. Female moose do not have antlers but protect their calves with kicks
		that can kill the predator. Moose are actually fast runners and great swimmers. They can run up to 35 miles per hour and hold their breath for 30 seconds.</p>

				<h3> Arctic Ground Squirrel </h3>
				<p>Spermophilus parryii, or arctic ground squirrels, hibernate in their burrows during the cold Alaskan winters for about 8 months. Females start
					to hibernate first, then the males follow. Male arctic ground squirrels are territorial and will actually kill infant ground squirrels on occasion.
				Females birth liters of 2 to 10 young, who are hairless and blind. Females will stay in groups to help protect from predators and some male arctic ground squirrels.
			Arctic ground squirrels will eat anything from leaves and fruits to eggs and juvenile Snowshoe hares.</p>

			<h3> Sea Otters </h3>
			<p>Sea Otters, or Enhydra lutris, weigh around 65 pounds and live up to 23 years. They are carnivores and usually eat clams, mussels and crabs. Sea otters
			dive to the ocean floor to grab their food and a rock. They then use the rock to smash the food against and eat the soft insides. Sea otters
		tend to sleep in the water with kelp wrapped around them so they don't float away. Female sea otters give birth in the water and nurse their young
	for 8 months. The mothers will tie their young to kelp when they go underwater in serach of food. </p>

			<h3> Bears </h3>
			<p>Ursus arctos, or brown bears, are one of the most common species of bear in Alaska. Brown bears are bigger than black bears, which can also
			be found in Alaska. Brown bears tend to eat salmon, berries and ground squirrels. They can even be predators to moose and caribou, especially the young.
		Black bears, or Ursus Americanus, is the smallest of the North American Bears. They usually weigh about 180-200 pounds but can be up to 350 pounds.
	Like the brown bear, they are omnivores and eat a variety of things. </p>

			<h3> Steller Sea Lions </h3>
			<p>Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) are the largest of the Otariidae (eared seals) family. Steller sea lions tend to sound like they're
			roaring rather than the barking sound that their relative, the California sea lions, make. While most sea lions and seals were hunted for their pelt,
		the Steller sea lions were hunted more for their meat than pelt. The male sea lions are larger than the females. Males can be 11 feet long and
	weigh 2,500 pounds. Females are 7.5 to 9.5 feet long and weigh around 800 pounds. Males fight to establish a breeding territory and mate with several females. </p>

			<h3> Snowshoe Hare </h3>
			<p>The scientific name of the Snowshoe Hare is Lepus americanus. They are called Snowshoe hares because of their large hind feet.
			The fur of this hare can change color with the seasons. In the winter it is white and in the summer it is brown. However, the tips of their
		ears are always black. They tend to eat plants, flowers and grass. Female hares give birth to up to 8 young, but many die before they mature.</p>
